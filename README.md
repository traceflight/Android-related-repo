# Android Related Repository

This is a repository that I use in my study about Android.

### By now, this repository includes: #

* `android.jar` files corresponding with android api versions.

* `repo` script with REPO_URL = 'https://gerrit-google.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git-repo'. So that Chinese user can download Android source code without proxy.
